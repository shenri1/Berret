# Berret — Fedora KDE Setup

Personal dotfiles and automated setup for a Fedora KDE environment. Installs packages, configures the desktop, sets up the terminal, and applies all config files in one shot.

---

## Requirements

- Fresh **Fedora KDE** installation
- Internet connection
- A non-root user account with `sudo` privileges

---

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shenri1/beret.git ~/.local/share/beret
cd ~/.local/share/beret
```

### 2. Run the installer

The installer must be run with `sudo`, but **not as root directly**. It needs to know your actual user account to configure files correctly.

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

> ⚠️ Do not run `sudo su` first and then `./install.sh`. Use `sudo ./install.sh` from your normal user session.

### 3. Follow the prompts

During installation, you will be asked for your **name** and **email address**. These are used to configure Git and generate XCompose shortcuts for quickly typing your identification.

### 4. Reboot

Once the script finishes, reboot your system for all changes to take effect.

```bash
reboot
```

---

## What gets configured

After installation, the following will be set up under your home directory:

- **`~/.bashrc`** — sources the Berret shell config (aliases, functions, prompt, editor)
- **`~/.config/`** — receives app configs (kitty, btop, fastfetch, xournalpp)
- **`~/.local/share/beret/`** — stores the bash modules and XCompose file
- **`~/.XCompose`** — keyboard shortcuts for emoji and typography, plus your name/email

---

## Post-install maintenance

A utility script is available to keep the system clean:

```bash
fedora-maintenance
```

This removes orphaned RPM packages, cleans DNF cache, removes unused Flatpaks, and clears the KDE thumbnail cache.
